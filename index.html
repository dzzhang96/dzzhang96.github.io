    <h1>Welcome</h1>

    <p>This is my academic website, where you can find information on my current and previous research experience. I am a graduate student majoring in <b>Mechanical Engineering</b> at <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca//">McGill University</a> since September 2020. I am actively looking for a position of internship in <abbr title="Time is flexible">Summer 2021</abbr>.</p>


    <p>
        My research interests focus on <b>robotics</b> and <b>biomechanical</b> related fields. I am now under the supervision of Prof. Mark Driscoll and co-supervised by Prof. Jorge Angeles. I have accumulated much experience of various types of robotics during my undergraduate study. I have also works in <b>medical image computation</b> via deep learning during periods at <a href="http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/">Shanghai Jiaotong University</a>, which you can see in my projects for detail.
