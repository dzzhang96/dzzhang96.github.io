<h1>Welcome</h1>
	
	<p>This is my academic website, where you can find information on my current and previous research experience. I am now a master student at <a href="http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/">Shanghai Jiaotong University</a> since last year and I will attend <a href="https://mcgill.ca/">McGill University</a> in Fall 2020. I am actively looking for a position of research assistant during <abbr title="Time is flexible">Summer 2020</abbr>.</p>

	<p>Though I major in mechanical engineering, my research interests focus on medical image analysis and a bit of robotics. I currently do my jobs in medical image segmentation based on U-net, which you can see in my projects for details. 
	And, I have also accumulated experience of various types of robotics in undergraduate study.</p>
