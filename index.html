	<p>This is my academic website, where you can find information on my current research and my former experience. I am now a master student at <a href="http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/">Shanghai Jiaotong University</a> and I will attend <a href="https://mcgill.ca/">McGill University</a> in Fall 2020.</p>

	<p>My research and teaching interests focus on the broad intersection of international conflict and political behavior. My current research agenda explores how external threats. I have published over 10 articles since 2012 in peer-reviewed journals like <em>Comparative Political Studies</em>.</p>
