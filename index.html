<h1>Welcome</h1>
	
	<p>This is my academic website, where you can find information on my current and previous research experience. I am a master student majored in mechanical engineering at <a href="http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/">Shanghai Jiaotong University</a> since last year. I am actively looking for a position of research assistant in <abbr title="Time is flexible">late 2020</abbr>.</p>

	<p>My research interests focus on robotics and biomedical related fields. I currently do my jobs in medical image segmentation based on U-net, which you can see in my projects for details. 
	And I have accumulated much experience of various types of robotics during my undergraduate study.</p>
