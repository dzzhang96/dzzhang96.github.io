    <h1>Welcome</h1>

    <p>
        Hi! My name is Dingzhong and this is my academic website. Here you can find my up-to-date and previous research projects. I am currently a graduate student majoring in <b>Mechanical Engineering</b> at <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca//">McGill University</a> since September 2020.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    	I have just finished my internship at <a href="https://www.medtronic.com/ca-en/index.html">Medtronic</a> and am actively looking for a position in related fields starting in <abbr title="Time is flexible">Summer 2022</abbr>.
	</p>

    <p>
        My research focuses on AR-based <b>surgical navigation</b> under the supervision of <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/mbr/people-1">Prof. Mark Driscoll</a> and co-supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OJRwcv8AAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Jorge Angeles</a> and <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/orthopaedics/our-team/ahmed-aoude-md-frcsc">Dr. Ahmed Aoude</a>. I have gained lots of experience in <b>medical image processing</b> via deep learning during periods at <a href="http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/">Shanghai Jiaotong University</a>. It is also worth mentioning that I had many interests in various types of <b>robots</b> during my undergraduate study, which you can see in my projects for details.
