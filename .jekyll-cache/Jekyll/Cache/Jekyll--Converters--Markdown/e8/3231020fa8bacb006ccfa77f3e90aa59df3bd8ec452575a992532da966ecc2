<p><em>Master Projects, Supervisor: Dr. Xiaojun Chen</em></p>

<p>Developed a software for doctors to select points for orbital rim registration, using QT and VTK.</p>

<p>3D reconstructed several skull CT-Scan data from DICOM.</p>

<p>Ameliorated the ICP algorithm to surface registration.</p>

<p><em>Master Projects, Supervisor: Dr. Xiaojun Chen</em></p>

<p>Manually segmented the bone graft in maxillary sinus to get the mask for training models based on
U-net 2D and 3D.</p>

<p>Converted Python image segmentation programs to C++ code, from training to prediction and defined a class.</p>

<p>Compiled Tensorflow C++ library to be used for software development.</p>

<p>You can find the code of prediction [here](<a href="https://github.com/dzzhang96/tf-predict-cpp">https://github.com/dzzhang96/tf-predict-cpp</a>.</p>
