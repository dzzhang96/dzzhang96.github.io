<p>My research focuses on international conflict, particularly over the distribution of territory. I examine the effect these territorial issues have on domestic politics, with a focus at the level of the individual citizen. Here, you can find materials relevant to my published research and research in progress.</p>

<p>I also provide titles for some working papers and works in progress below. I provide full links for these papers when I believe they are ready for peer review. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in some of these projects. <a href="http://svmiller.com/cv/">My CV</a> contains more information about where some of these projects are in the peer review process.</p>

<p>I also offer <a href="/docs/svm-research-statement.pdf">a three-page research statement</a> that summarizes and contextualizes my different research agendas.</p>
