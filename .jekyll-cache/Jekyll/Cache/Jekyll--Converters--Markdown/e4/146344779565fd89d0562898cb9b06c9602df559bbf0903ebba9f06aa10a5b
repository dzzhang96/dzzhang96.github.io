I"§<p>My research focuses on both <em>medical image computation</em> and <em>robotics</em>.</p>

<p>I started the latter one since I entered Shanghai Jiaotong University as a master student last year</p>

<p>in progress</p>

<p>Here you can find projects relevant to my previous and on going research in detail.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://dzzhang96.github.io/Research/Robotics/">Robotics</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And I also provide my <a href="https://dzzhang96.github.io/cv/">CV</a> which summarizes all these projects by time.</p>
