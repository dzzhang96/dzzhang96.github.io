I"Ô<p>My research focuses on both <em>medical image computation</em> and <em>robotics</em>.</p>

<p>Medical image computation is my main theme since I entered Shanghai Jiaotong University as a master student last year. Around it, I acquired skills such as Visualization (VTK), medical image â€¦(ITK) and began to delve into deep learning frame. I  progressed much my coding ability through programming practical softwares based on C++ and QT.</p>

<p>As to robotics, it is with strong enthusiasm that I have participated in many related activities during undergraduate study. I have broaden my interest to various types of robots, including ABB industrial robots, Rethink Baxter (a cobot), UAV, AGV and my own 3d-printed rehabilitation robotic arm. As a result, I experienced</p>
