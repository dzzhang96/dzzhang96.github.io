I"õ<p>My research interests lie in three medical-related areas: <strong>Augmented Reality</strong>, <strong>Medical Image Processing</strong> and <strong>Robotics</strong>.</p>

<p>My graduate thesis focused on <strong>AR-based surgical navigation system</strong>, which is targeted at providing a high-quality visualization and an accurate navigation during the spine surgery. This includes the <strong>calibration</strong> between <em>HoloLens</em> and <em>Polaris</em> (a surgical tool tracking device), the <strong>registration</strong> between real and virtual models and the optimized 3D reconstructed models from DICOM by using deep learning for <strong>automatic image segmentation</strong>.</p>

<p>I gained most of my experience in medical image processing at Shanghai Jiaotong University as a graduate student from year 2019. I acquired skills of <strong>OpenCV</strong>, image visualization (<strong>VTK</strong>), medical image processing (<strong>ITK</strong>), software development (<strong>Qt</strong>) and then delved into <strong>Deep Learning</strong>. Concurrently, I progressed my coding skills using <strong>C++</strong> and <strong>Python</strong>.</p>

<p>As to robotics, it is with strong enthusiasm that I have participated in many related activities during my undergraduate study. I have extended my interests to various types of robots, including my 3d-printed <strong>rehabilitation robotic arm</strong>, the <strong>Rethink Baxter</strong> (a cobot), <strong>ABB industrial robots</strong>, <strong>UAV</strong> and <strong>AGV</strong>. I developed my skills not only in controls mechanical design but also in <strong>controls</strong> and PCB designing as well.</p>
