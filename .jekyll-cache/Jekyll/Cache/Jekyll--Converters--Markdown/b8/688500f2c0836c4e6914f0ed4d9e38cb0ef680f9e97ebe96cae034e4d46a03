I"Û<p>My research focuses on robotics and image processing.</p>

<p>Medical image analysis is my main theme during the time at Shanghai Jiaotong University as a master student last year. Around it, I acquired skills of image visualization (VTK), medical image processing (ITK) and delved into Deep Learning. I also progressed my coding skills using C++ and QT.</p>

<p>As to robotics, it is with strong enthusiasm that I have participated in many related activities since undergraduate study. I have extended my interests to various types of robots, including my own 3d-printed rehabilitation robotic arm, Rethink Baxter (a cobot), ABB industrial robots, UAV and AGV. As a result, I developed my abilities not only in mechanical design but also in controls and PCB designing as well.</p>
