<p><strong>Biomechanical Analysis of Knee-Joint Prosthesis</strong></p>

<p><em>Final Year Project, Orthotek Lab, Supervisor: Dr. Zikai Hua</em></p>

<p>§ Utilized
an ABB IRB6700 robotic arm to simulate physiological loading conditions and to
perform kinematic (normal walking) test on a human knee-joint prosthesis.</p>

<p>§ Planned robot
path according to anterior-posterior translation, medial-lateral rotation, flexion-extension
rotation of knee-joint in MATLAB Robotic Toolbox and programmed in RobotStudio.</p>

<p>§ Controlled
and detected physiological loading by using a multidimensional force sensor, Beckhoff
embedded PC, and secondary developed software based on TwinCat.</p>

<p>§ Designed
new fixtures, including a flange, an adapter flange, trapezoidal
grooves, and two barrels for PMMA solidification for
linking knee-joint prosthesis with robotic arm.</p>

<p>§ Established
a dynamic optical measuring system to observe knee-joint kinematics in gait after collecting data from ARAMIS, GOM by sticking markers on the
surface of prosthesis.</p>

<p><strong>Design of A Medical
Rehabilitation Robotic Arm</strong> 01/2018-06/2018</p>

<p><em>Third Year Project, First Prize
in Chinese Service Robot Competition (Innovative design of rehabilitation robot)
2018, Supervisor: Dr. Bin He</em></p>

<p>§ Designed a prototype
of four DOF robotic arm, which can predict
patient’s arm movement and help do rehabilitation exercises.</p>

<p>§ Developed
an integrated system of a robotic arm, a multiple sensor, a windows forms application programmed in c#, a servos’ control system
in Arduino where messages are detected and exchanged through the serial
communication ports.</p>

<p>§ Deduced an empirical formula of
the multiple sensor - Leap Motion to control four servos with detected
coordinate points after many attempts.</p>

<p>§ Set a parameter to regulate the
sensitivity of the robotic arm for different patients.</p>

<p>§ Simulated and conducted force
analysis in Ansys under various situations.</p>

<p><strong>A Novel FPV Racing Drone</strong> 05/2018-06/2018</p>

<p><em>One of Two Team members, First Prize in China
Aerial Robotics Competition 2018, Supervisor: Dr. Di Wang</em></p>

<p>§ Built an
FPV with 4 brushless motors (4800kv) with 3-leaf propellers on each, a carbon
fiber frame, 4 in 1 ESCs, F3 flight controller, and
the altimeter, barometer, video transmitter, etc. on boards.</p>

<p>§ Tuned the PID to make the drone both
steady and agile for the match.</p>

<p>§ 3D-printed
a knife rest for a ceramic blade to penetrate several balloons on the game day.</p>

<p><strong>Programming and Design of a
PCB Layout of an AGV</strong> 11/2017-03/2018</p>

<p><em>Team leader, Third Prize in China Robot Match
(Travel and Security) 2018, Supervisor: Dr. Di Wang</em></p>

<p>§ Programmed
the vehicle for passing through different kinds of terrain and make corresponding
actions (driven by four servos) after scanning QR codes.</p>

<p>§ Designed
and soldered an expansion PCB to be set on the STM32 for improving the
reliability instead of connecting different parts with Dupont cables.</p>

<p>§ Added an
automatic steering system by installing 16 gray-scale sensors, 4 ultrasonic
sensors and optimized the algorithm to have a quick response.</p>
