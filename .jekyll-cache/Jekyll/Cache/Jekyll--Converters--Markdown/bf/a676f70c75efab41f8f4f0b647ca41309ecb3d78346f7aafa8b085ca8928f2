I"m<p>My research focuses on both <em>medical image computation</em> and <em>robotics</em>.</p>

<p>Since I entered Shanghai Jiaotong University as a master student last year,</p>

<p>I have learned much about medical image analysis, from</p>

<p>As to robotics, it is with strong interest that I have participated in various activities of robots during my undergraduate study. Robotic arm baxter (cobot), UAV and AGV</p>

<p>Here you can find projects relevant to my previous and on going research in detail.</p>
