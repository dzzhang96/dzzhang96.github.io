I",<p>My research focuses on both <em>robotics</em> and <em>medical image computation</em>.</p>

<p>I also provide titles for some working papers and works in progress below. I provide full links for these papers when I believe they are ready for peer review. contains more information about where some of these projects are in the peer review process.</p>

<p>Here you can find projects relevant to my previous and on going research in detail.</p>

<ul>

    <p><a href="https://dzzhang96.github.io/Research/Medical%20Image%20Computation/">Medical Image Computation</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://dzzhang96.github.io/Research/Robotics/">Robotics</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And I also provide my <a href="https://dzzhang96.github.io/cv/">CV</a> which summarizes all these projects by time.</p>
