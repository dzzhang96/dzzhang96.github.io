I"<p>My research focuses on both medical image computation and robotics.</p>

<p>Medical image computation is my main theme since I entered Shanghai Jiaotong University as a master student last year. Around it, I acquired skills such as Visualization (VTK), medical image â€¦(ITK) and began to delve into deep learning frame. I   also progressed much my coding ability through programming some practical softwares based on C++ and QT.</p>

<p>As to robotics, it is with strong enthusiasm that I have participated in many related activities during undergraduate study. I have extended my interests to various types of robots, including Rethink Baxter (a cobot), ABB industrial robots, UAV, AGV and my own 3d-printed rehabilitation robotic arm. As a result, I broadened my not only in  but also and PCB designing as well.</p>
