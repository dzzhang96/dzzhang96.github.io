My research interests lie in three medical-related areas: **Augmented Reality**, **Medical Image Processing** and **Robotics**. 

My graduate thesis focused on **AR-based surgical navigation system**, which is targeted at providing a high-quality visualization and an accurate navigation during the spine surgery. This includes the **calibration** between *HoloLens* and *Polaris* (a surgical tool tracking device), the **registration** between real and virtual models and the optimized 3D reconstructed models from DICOM by using deep learning for **automatic image segmentation**.

I gained most of my experience in medical image processing at Shanghai Jiaotong University as a graduate student from year 2019. I acquired skills of **OpenCV**, image visualization (**VTK**), medical image processing (**ITK**), software development (**Qt**) and then delved into **Deep Learning**. Concurrently, I progressed my coding skills using **C++** and **Python**.

As to robotics, it is with strong enthusiasm that I have participated in many related activities during my undergraduate study. I have extended my interests to various types of robots, including my 3d-printed **rehabilitation robotic arm**, the **Rethink Baxter** (a cobot), **ABB industrial robots**, **UAV** and **AGV**. I developed my skills not only in controls mechanical design but also in **controls** and PCB designing as well. 

Here you can find projects relevant to my ongoing and previous research in details.

- [Medical Image Computation](https://dzzhang96.github.io/Research/Medical%20Image%20Computation/)

- [Robotics](https://dzzhang96.github.io/Research/Robotics/)

And I also provide my [CV](https://dzzhang96.github.io/cv/) which summarizes all these projects by time.
