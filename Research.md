My research focuses on medical image analysis and robotics. 

Medical image analysis is my main theme since I entered Shanghai Jiaotong University as a master student last year. Around it, I acquired skills of image visualization (VTK), medical image processing (ITK) and delved into Deep Learning. I also progressed my coding skills through programming practical softwares in C++ and QT.

As to robotics, it is with strong enthusiasm that I have participated in many related activities during undergraduate study. I have extended my interests to various types of robots, including my own 3d-printed rehabilitation robotic arm, Rethink Baxter (a cobot), ABB industrial robots, UAV and AGV. As a result, I developed my abilities not only in mechanical design but also in controls and PCB designing as well. 

Here you can find projects relevant to my ongoing and previous research in detail.

- [Robotics](https://dzzhang96.github.io/Research/Robotics/)

And I also provide my [CV](https://dzzhang96.github.io/cv/) which summarizes all these projects by time.
