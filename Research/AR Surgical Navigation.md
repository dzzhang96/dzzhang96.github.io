As to robotics, it is with strong enthusiasm that I have participated in many related activities since undergraduate study, especially those applications in biomechanics. I have extended my interests to various types of robots, including my own 3d-printed rehabilitation robotic arm, Rethink Baxter (a cobot), ABB industrial robots, UAV and AGV. As a result, I developed my abilities not only in mechanical design but also in controls and PCB designing as well.

### **Biomechanical Analysis of Knee-Joint Prosthesis**

12/2018-07/2019

*Final Year Project, [Orthotek Lab](http://www.orthotek-lab.org/?_l=en), Supervisor: Dr. Zikai Hua*

- Utilized an ABB IRB6700 robotic arm to simulate physiological loading conditions and to perform kinematic (normal walking) test on a human knee-joint prosthesis.

- Planned robot path according to anterior-posterior translation, medial-lateral rotation, flexion-extension rotation of knee-joint in MATLAB Robotic Toolbox and programmed in RobotStudio.

- Controlled and detected physiological loading by using a multidimensional force sensor, Beckhoff embedded PC, and secondary developed software based on TwinCat.

- Designed new fixtures, including a flange, an adapter flange, trapezoidal
  grooves, and two barrels for PMMA solidification for linking knee-joint prosthesis with robotic arm.

- Established a dynamic optical measuring system to observe knee-joint kinematics in gait after collecting data from ARAMIS, GOM by sticking markers on the surface of prosthesis.
