I gained most of my experience in medical image processing at Shanghai Jiaotong University as a graduate student from year 2019. I acquired skills of **OpenCV**, image visualization (**VTK**), medical image processing (**ITK**), software development (**Qt**) and then delved into **Deep Learning**. Concurrently, I progressed my coding skills using **C++** and **Python**.

### **[[Code](https://github.com/dzzhang96/Points-Registration-ICP)] Orbital Rim Registration Software V1.1**

01/2020-06/2020

*Master Project, Supervisor: Dr. Xiaojun Chen*

- A software for point clouds registration based on VTK7.0 and Qt5.0. (you can cmake itüòÄ)The basic algorithm is ICP, the number of iterations is set to 50.

- The upper left window renders the stable STL while the upper right window can be input several STLs for transformation.

- You can either registrate by right clicking (to get points) on STL or registrate directly by point clouds.

You can find details [here](https://github.com/dzzhang96/Points-Registration-ICP).

### **[[Code](https://github.com/dzzhang96/tf-predict-cpp)] Medical Image Segmentation using Tensorflow C++ API**

09/2019-11/2019

{% include image.html url="/images/vnet.jpg" caption="Mandible Segmentation" width=365 align="right" %}

*Master Project, Supervisor: Dr. Xiaojun Chen*

- Shortened calculation time for medical image computation software by integrating deep learning.

- Compiled the Tensorflow C++ library and converted image segmentation programs from Python to C++.

- Developed automatic labeling algorithms based on U-net/V-net to segment mandible and bone graft in maxillary sinus.
