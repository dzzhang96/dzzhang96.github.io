### **Orbital Rim Registration Software**

01/2020-present

*Master Projects, Supervisor: Dr. Xiaojun Chen*

Developed a software for doctors to select points for orbital rim registration, using QT and VTK.

3D reconstructed several skull CT-Scan data from DICOM.

Ameliorated the ICP algorithm to surface registration.

### **Medical Image Segmentation using Tensorflow C++ API**

09/2019-11/2019

*Master Projects, Supervisor: Dr. Xiaojun Chen*

Manually segmented the maxillary sinus to get the mask for training models based on
U-net 2D and 3D.

Converted Python image segmentation programs to C++ code, from training to prediction and defined a class.

Compiled Tensorflow C++ library to be used for software development.
