### **Orbital Rim Registration Software**

01/2020-present

*Master Projects, Supervisor: Dr. Xiaojun Chen*

Developed a software for doctors to select points for orbital rim registration, using QT and VTK.

3D reconstructed several skull CT-Scan data from DICOM.

Ameliorated the ICP algorithm to surface registration.

*Master Projects, Supervisor: Dr. Xiaojun Chen*

- Manually segmented the bone graft in maxillary sinus to get the mask for training models based on U-net 2D and 3D.

- Compiled Tensorflow C++ library and converted Python image segmentation programs to C++ code for prediction

- Defined a class to integrate deep learning into other medical image processing software.

You can find the code [here](https://github.com/dzzhang96/tf-predict-cpp).
