### **Biomechanical Analysis of Knee-Joint Prosthesis**

12/2018-07/2019

*Final Year Project, [Orthotek Lab](http://www.orthotek-lab.org/?_l=en), Supervisor: Dr. Zikai Hua*

- Utilized an ABB IRB6700 robotic arm to simulate physiological loading conditions and to perform kinematic (normal walking) test on a human knee-joint prosthesis.

- Planned robot path according to anterior-posterior translation, medial-lateral rotation, flexion-extension rotation of knee-joint in MATLAB Robotic Toolbox and programmed in RobotStudio.

- Controlled and detected physiological loading by using a multidimensional force sensor, Beckhoff embedded PC, and secondary developed software based on TwinCat.

- Designed new fixtures, including a flange, an adapter flange, trapezoidal
  grooves, and two barrels for PMMA solidification for linking knee-joint prosthesis with robotic arm.

- Established a dynamic optical measuring system to observe knee-joint kinematics in gait after collecting data from ARAMIS, GOM by sticking markers on the surface of prosthesis.

*Third Year Project, First Prize in Chinese Service Robot Competition (Innovative design of rehabilitation robot) 2018, Supervisor: Dr. Bin He*

- Designed a prototype of four DOF robotic arm, which can predict patient’s arm movement and help do rehabilitation exercises.

- Developed an integrated system of a robotic arm, a multiple sensor, a windows forms application programmed in c#, a servos’ control system in Arduino where messages are detected and exchanged through the serial communication ports.

- Deduced an empirical formula of the multiple sensor - Leap Motion to control four servos with detected coordinate points after many attempts.

- Set a parameter to regulate the sensitivity of the robotic arm for different patients.

- Simulated and conducted force analysis in Ansys under various situations.

### **A Novel FPV Racing Drone**

05/2018-06/2018

*One of Two Team members, First Prize in China Aerial Robotics Competition 2018, Supervisor: Dr. Di Wang*

- Built an FPV with 4 brushless motors (4800kv) with 3-leaf propellers on each, a carbon
  fiber frame, 4 in 1 ESCs, F3 flight controller, and the altimeter, barometer, video transmitter, etc. on boards.

- Tuned the PID to make the drone both steady and agile for the match.

- 3D-printed a knife rest for a ceramic blade to penetrate several balloons on the game day.

### **Programming and Design of a PCB Layout of an AGV**

11/2017-03/2018

*Team leader, Third Prize in China Robot Match (Travel and Security) 2018, Supervisor: Dr. Di Wang*

- Programmed the vehicle for passing through different kinds of terrain and make corresponding actions (driven by four servos) after scanning QR codes.

- Designed and soldered an expansion PCB to be set on the STM32 for improving the
  reliability instead of connecting different parts with Dupont cables.

- Added an automatic steering system by installing 16 gray-scale sensors, 4 ultrasonic
  sensors and optimized the algorithm to have a quick response.
