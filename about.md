I have many interests outside of the academy, but I'd like to talk about something else here. <img src="/images/Doraemon-4.gif" width= "5%" class="align-left" alt="">

At the beginning of year 2020, I created this website trying to find opportunities for visiting students at University of Pennsylvania, as I wished long ago. However, the COVID-19 changed everything and I had to cancel my plan at that moment. Truth be told, I then came to realize that it is not the university but somewhere in my memory I kept looking for.

>How happy is the blameless vestal's lot. The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind. Each pray’r accepted, and each wish resign’d.
