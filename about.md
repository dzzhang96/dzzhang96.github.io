I have many interests outside of the academy, but I'd like to talk about something else here. <img src="/images/Doraemon-4.gif" width= "5%" class="align-left" alt="">

At the beginning of year 2020, I created this website trying to find opportunities for visiting student at University of Pennsylvania, as I wished long ago. However, the COVID-19 changed everything. Truth be told, neither I got upset, nor I was to give up.

>In secret we metâ€”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence I grieve,<br>
That thy heart could forget,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy spirit deceive.<br>
If I should meet thee<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After long years,<br>
How should I greet thee?

Awh!!! <img src="/images/Doraemon-3.gif" width= "5%" class="align-left" alt=""> My teeth hurt again!!!!<img src="/images/Doraemon-5.gif" width= "6%" class="align-left" alt="">
