I do have interests outside of the academy, and really many. But I'd like to talk about something else here.

I created this website for opportunities  of research assistant, as I mentioned in the welcome page.  However, truth be told, I used this only for application of UPenn. If you asked me why, the reason is that...awh!!! I'm toothache!!!!
