I have many interests outside of the academy, but I'd like to talk about something else here. <img src="/images/Doraemon-4.gif" width= "5%" class="align-left" alt="">

At the beginning of year 2020, I created this website trying to find opportunities for visiting students at the University of Pennsylvania. However, the COVID-19 changed everything and I had to cancel my plan at that moment. I did not feel pity because I know it is not the university, but something else in my memory I was looking for. The squirrels on the grass, the sunshine across the leaves, the frozen lake in late winter, and my uneasiness of mind waiting in the library. They were lost, gradually and quietly over time. And I cannot stop it.

>How happy is the blameless vestal's lot. The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind. Each pray’r accepted, and each wish resign’d.

Awh!!! <img src="/images/Doraemon-3.gif" width= "5%" class="align-left" alt=""> My teeth hurt again!!!!<img src="/images/Doraemon-5.gif" width= "6%" class="align-left" alt="">
